# cs4300sp2017-smart-playlist

Final project for CS 4300 - Language and Information. This project allows a user to input a seed song and configure parameters
such as Lyric Similarity, Song Feature Similarity, and Cooccurring Playlist Similarity. The system, in turn, returns a playlist
of songs the user may find enjoyable.
